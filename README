Compiling the mDirac mex program
================================
Marc Joliet <marcec@gmx.de>

Introduction
------------

This document explains how to compile mDirac.

mDirac is a mex wrapper for the time-stretching/pitch-shifting C library Dirac,
written by Stephan Bernsee of www.dspdimension.com.  It works with Matlab arrays
of arbitrary MxN dimension, M being the number of samples per channel and N
being the number of channels, as returned by, e.g., 'wavread()'.

Compiling
---------

Currently, mDirac is compiled with the help of a CMake based build system.  On
Linux, there is a limited SCons based build system available, but it is
currently incomplete.  For details, see the relevant subsection.

A problem of both systems is that at least two things are not implemented.  For
one thing: installing.  It is expected that you copy the resulting binaries to
wherever your Matlab installation looks for them.  The other problem: on
Windows, required DLLs are not copied into the Visual Studio build directory.
This means you have to add an appropriate command to the VS project file or copy
the DLLs yourself.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mDirac has no external dependencies as the Dirac library is bundled.

Using the CMake based build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux
^^^^^

Just open a terminal and type

-----------------
    $ cmake .
-----------------

while in the source directory.  This will produce a Makefile that works as
expected, save for the aforementioned caveats.  Alternatively, you can use the
'cmake-gui' application (see Windows subsection for a small introduction).

Windows
^^^^^^^

Under Windows it is recommended to use the 'cmake-gui' application. Follow these steps:

    1. Select the source and build directories (typically identical).
    2. Click on 'Configure' to configure the build system.  Upon first use, you
       will be prompted for the target, i.e. which IDE/compiler you use.
    3. Click on 'Generate'.  This will, as the name implies, generates a project
       file for your IDE of choice.

You should now have an IDE project file in the source directory.  Open it and
start compilation.

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

On Mac OS X you can either follow the same steps as under Linux or under
Windows according to your own preferences.

Using the SCons based build system (Linux only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the SCons based build system was written to work on my computer (a
Linux box).  It will, in general, work on any Linux machine with:

    - a 32 bit compiler and libraries
      and
    - Matlab installed in '/opt/matlab/'.

If those requirements are met, simple typing 'scons' in the source directory
will compile everything.

Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

`
Right now this is just a small hobby project of mine. I do not intend it to
replace the CMake based build system (though I hope it will). The following are
just my current thoughts on the topic.
`

You might ask why I would try out SCons if I already have a working CMake based
build system.  There are two main reasons I decided to explore SCons:

    1. CMake seems (to me) to be unnecessarily complex to use.  It certainly
       seems more complex than promised.  Maybe it is because I am using it in a
       comparatively tiny project?

    2. SCons is written and extended in Python, which to me is a huge plus over
       the custom language used by CMake.

And to be honest, what reminded me of SCons in the first place is
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1877[this blog entry], in which several people,
including `Eric Raymond` (of "The Art of Unix Programming" and "The Cathedral
and the Bazaar" fame), express their preference of SCons over other build
systems.  The Python based "waf" also seems promising, though its development is
supposedly still strongly in flux.  So I thought SCons would be worth trying
out.

So far, the resulting 'SConstruct' file is about 1/2 of the size of the
'CMakeLists.txt' file (76 vs. 155 lines) and is IMHO also much easier to read.

However, SCons is not without problems.  One issue for me is the lack of a
'FindMatlab.cmake' equivalent.  There are, however, some options.  There is a
'mex.py' python module on the SCons Wiki that finds and uses the mex wrapper
script and sets the 'MEX_EXT' environment variable automatically.  I will
probably create something else based off of it that acts like 'FindMatlab.cmake'
so that I can keep the flexibility (and sanity) of a real build system.  In
fact, while I am at it, I can have it automatically set appropriate options,
e.g., '-fexceptions'.  That would further shrink the SConstruct file.

For Windows there will be a couple more problems:
    - You need to install Python, which is one installation more than with CMake
      (wow, how horrible).
    - SCons works as a self-contained system, meaning its purpose is not to
      *generate* a build system like CMake does, but to *be* one and thus run by
      itself (hence why it is often described as a Make replacement).  However,
      there are at least three options:
        - a function to create a VS solution file, which I have not tested
        - using SCons as an external build tool in VS, and
        - adding the SCons installation directory to PATH and calling it from a
          VS console.
    - The 'FindMatlab.cmake' vs. 'mex.py' issue above might be harder to solve
      on Windows. I need to see if Matlab appends to the PATH variable and uses
      the same options as the starter scripts under Unix. If the first is the case,
      I could use the same code on all platforms and open Matlab as a
      sub-process, use getenv() and parse the output (slow, but the results will
      be cached). If both are the case (I doubt it), I could just grab the
      necessary variables from the output of

          ---------------
            $ matlab -e
          ---------------

      and be done with it.
